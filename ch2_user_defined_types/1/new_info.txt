member initializer list
	Vector(int s) : elem {new double[]} , sz{s} {}
	Vector_container(int s) : v(s) {}

	how does it work exactly? does it only allow to initialize members? Or can I execute any operation?

operator[]
operator++
operator>>
...

Can I literally do the same in a struct as in a class (functions, constructor, operator[], destructor, etc.)?

unions
