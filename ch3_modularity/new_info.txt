interface separated from implementation
	.h vs .cpp
	separated compilation

namespaces
	similar to java packages

noexcept functions:
	a function that doesn't throw an exception
	if the function still throws an exception, std::termiante() is called

static_assert(A, S)
	prints S if A is not true
	A must be known at compile time (constant expression)
